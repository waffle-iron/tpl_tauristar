What is this?
---------------------
This repository shows an approach how to introduce CSS/JS frameworks like bootstrap 3 or font awesome into the current Joomla version.

How to get started?
---------------------
Install Joomla as usual by downloading it from this repository. As default template is tauristar set, which loads the bootstrap 3 framework without any customziation.

You can install the sample blog data on the last installation screen or create some sample articles by yourself.

What is new?
---------------------
Layouts are loaded with prefixes like bs3 to define which framework should be loaded. For example when protostar is activated, then the file (default.bs3.php)[modules/mod_menu/tmpl/default.bs3.php] is loaded instead of the (default.php)[modules/mod_menu/tmpl/default.php] file. The same works for component views and JLayouts.

How to contribute?
---------------------
Play around with the installation and convert some layout files to bootstrap 3., DOn't forget to open a pull request!!
